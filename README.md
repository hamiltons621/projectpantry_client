# Project: Pantry ü•ï

A lot of people with ADHD (and other executive functioning disorders) struggle \
when it comes to making meals. Things like disorganization, impulsivity, sensory \
struggles, lack or overload of stimulation, decision fatigue and the dreaded ‚Äúout \
of sight, out of mind‚Äù can make a maintained kitchen and food routine really \
challenging.\ **Project: Pantry** aims to provide structure via food inventory \
and easy-to-access safe foods to remove some of the barriers someone may face when \
grocery shopping and choosing a meal. 

**Project: Pantry**, built with React.js and Python/Django, allows users to create \
an inventory of all foods in their kitchen. No more forgetting an ingredient or \
buying duplicates of things that were hidden on the back of the shelf. A location \
can be added so users never forget where a food is stored, and predefined quantity \
levels allow users to easily keep track of quantity without distracting, detailed \
measurements. Custom tags allow users to organize their foods in a way that suits \
them best. Foods can also be marked as safe foods. These foods will be displayed \
at the top of every page to ensure easy access for days when a user is trying to \
beat an impulsive delivery order or struggling to cook and/or eat.
